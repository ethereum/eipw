        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>
          <code>prevent-urls-no-backticks</code> flags URLs that are in
          backticks, which can make them less readable or clickable. It is
          important to avoid URLs in backticks to ensure content
          integrity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Backticks are generally used for code snippets or inline code, not for
          wrapping URLs. Including them can cause confusion and disrupt the
          readability or functionality of the URLs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This rule ensures that URLs are formatted correctly, and that only
          specific domains (if configured) are allowed to be used, adding an
          additional layer of security and ensuring consistent documentation.
