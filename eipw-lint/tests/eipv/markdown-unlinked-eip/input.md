## Abstract
This is the abstract for the EIP, which extends EIP-1234.

This is also the abstract for the EIP, which extends ERC-1236.

## Motivation
This is the motivation for the EIP, which is separate from [EIP-1235](./eip-1235.md).

This is also the abstract for the EIP, which extends [ERC-1237](./eip-1237.md).

## Specification
This is the specification for the EIP, mentioning EIP-1235 and ERC-1237 again.

## Rationale
This is the rationale for the EIP, which extends [EIP-1234](./eip-1234.md) and
[ERC-1236](./eip-1236.md).

## Backwards Compatibility
These are the backwards compatibility concerns. This reference EIP-1 is a self
reference and shouldn't generate an error.

## Test Cases
These are the test cases for the EIP.

## Reference Implementation
This is the implementation for the EIP, but `ERC721` should be allowed.

## Security Considerations
These are the security considerations for the EIP.
